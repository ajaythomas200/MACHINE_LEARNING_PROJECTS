# Employee Dataset Preprocessing

# Overview:

The goal of this project is to design and implement a robust data preprocessing system that addresses challenges such as:

* Missing values
* Outliers
* Inconsistent formatting
* Categorical variable encoding
* By performing effective preprocessing, we aim to enhance the
  data quality for further machine learning analysis.

# Dataset Description

The dataset contains the following columns:

**Company Name:** Name of the company.

**Employee Age:** Age of the employee.

**Employee Salary:** Employee's salary.

**Place:** The city where the employee works.

**Country:** Country where the employee works.

**Gender:** Employee's Gender.

# Preprocessing Steps

## 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* Examined the dataset to list down the unique values in each
  feature and calculated their lengths.
* Renamed the columns for better readability.
 
## 2. Handling Missing and Inappropriate Values
* Replaced 0 values in the Employee Age column with NaN values.
* Filled missing values in Employee Age and Employee Salary
  columns using the mean value of the respective columns.
* Replaced missing values in the Company and Place columns with
  mode value.

## 3. Removing Duplicate Rows
* Identified and removed duplicate rows to ensure data quality.

## 4. Handling Outliers
* Used visualizations such as box plots to identify outliers in
  numerical columns (e.g., salary, age).
* Treated the outliers using IQR method as needed.

## 5. Categorical Variable Encoding
* Applied One-Hot Encoding to convert categorical variables like
  Company and Place into numerical format for analysis using 
  machine learning algorithms.

## 6. Scaling Features
* Used StandardScaler and MinMaxScaler to scale the numerical
  features (e.g., salary, age) to a standard range, improving the
  performance of machine learning models.

## 7. Filtering Data
* Filtered data to select employees with age > 40 and salary <
  5000.
* Visualized this filtered dataset by plotting Age vs. Salary and a bar chart representing the number of employees in each city.
  
## 8. Final Data
* After preprocessing, the dataset is now clean, properly formatted, and ready for machine learning algorithms to build predictive models.

## Libraries
 To run the preprocessing steps, you will need the following libraries:
* Python
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* Scikit-learn

## Visualization
* **Scatter Plot:** Relationship Between Age and Salary.
* **Bar Chart:** Distribution of Employees from Different Places.
